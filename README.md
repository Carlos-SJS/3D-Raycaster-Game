# Duum

Duum is a 2.5D raycaster game, inspired by games like Wolfenstin 3D and DOOM I and DOOM II.

This game is written in C++, using cocos2d-x game engine to help manage some stuff. This project was part of advanced programming class.

The game has 3 different levels, with diferent types of monsters, and en each level you have to find a terminal to complete it and pass to the next level, but you have to be carefull not to lose all your hp while you are at it.
